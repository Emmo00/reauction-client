A way for Farcaster users to regain value from investing in other creators by auctioning or reselling their Farcaster collectibles (cast NFTs).

## Overview

Farcaster introduced a feature called **Collectible Casts**, a mechanism that allows every cast to be collected. This is handled through an ascending auction, which determines the final price and owner.  
The goal of this project is create a market for second hand **Collectible Casts** buy enabling owners to enable cast NFT owners to resell and earn rewards.
