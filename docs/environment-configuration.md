# Environment-Based Configuration Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Constants (`src/lib/constants.ts`)

Added two new helper functions to handle environment-based configuration:

```typescript
/**
 * Get the appropriate auction contract address based on environment
 */
export const getAuctionContractAddress = (): string => {
  return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
    ? AUCTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS 
    : AUCTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA;
};

/**
 * Get the appropriate CoinbaSeQL database schema based on environment
 */
export const getCoinbaseQLSchema = (): string => {
  return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'base' : 'base_sepolia';
};
```

### 2. Updated API Endpoint (`src/app/api/collectible-status/[address]/route.ts`)

Modified the collectible status API to:
- Import the new environment-based functions
- Use dynamic contract address based on environment  
- Use dynamic schema (`base` vs `base_sepolia`) based on environment
- Add logging to show which environment configuration is being used

### 3. Environment Logic

| Environment | Contract Address | CoinbaSeQL Schema | Network |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Production (`NODE_ENV=production`) | `AUCTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | `base` | Base Mainnet |
| Development/Test (any other `NODE_ENV`) | `AUCTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA` | `base_sepolia` | Base Sepolia |

### 4. SQL Query Changes

**Before:**
```sql
FROM base.events
WHERE address = '0x3af2fc5ed9c3da8f669e34fd6aba5a87afc933ae'
```

**After:**
```sql
FROM ${schema}.events  -- 'base' or 'base_sepolia'
WHERE address = '${contractAddress}'  -- environment-specific contract
```

### 5. Added Tests

Created comprehensive tests in `src/lib/__tests__/constants.test.ts` to verify:
- Correct contract address selection based on `NODE_ENV`
- Correct schema selection based on `NODE_ENV`
- Proper fallback behavior for different environments

## Usage Examples

### Development Environment
```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm run dev
```
- Uses `base_sepolia.events` table
- Uses sepolia contract address
- Perfect for testing with testnet data

### Production Environment  
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run build && npm start
```
- Uses `base.events` table
- Uses mainnet contract address
- Queries live mainnet data

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Environment Detection**: No manual configuration needed
2. **Testnet Support**: Easy testing with Base Sepolia data during development
3. **Production Ready**: Seamlessly switches to mainnet data in production
4. **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper return types
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality unchanged

## Verification

✅ **Build Test**: `npm run build` passes successfully
✅ **Environment Logic**: Tested with both production and development configs
✅ **Type Safety**: All TypeScript compilation successful
✅ **Logging**: Added environment-specific logging for debugging

The API will now automatically use the correct blockchain network and contract address based on your deployment environment!
